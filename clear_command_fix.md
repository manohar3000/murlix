# /clear Command Fix Documentation

## Issue Description
The `/clear` slash command was not working properly. Even after clearing the conversation history, the agent still had access to previous interactions and could reference them in subsequent responses.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the implementation of the session clearing mechanism:

1. **Database-Only Clear**: The original `clear_session` method only deleted and recreated the session in the database
2. **Stale Runner Object**: The `Runner` object in the main chat loop maintained its own internal state and conversation history, which persisted after the database session was cleared
3. **Session ID Reuse**: Attempting to recreate a session with the same ID may not properly clear the event history in the ADK framework
4. **Event History Persistence**: The Google ADK stores conversation history as events in the session, and these events might persist even after session recreation with the same ID

## Fix Implementation

### 1. Updated `SessionManager.clear_session` Method
- **File**: `cli/session.py`
- **Change**: Modified the method to create a completely new session with a new ID and return a new `Runner` instance
- **Purpose**: Ensures both the session and runner are completely fresh with no residual state

```python
async def clear_session(self, session_id: str) -> Tuple[Runner, str]:
    """Clear a session and return a new Runner instance with a new session."""
    # Delete the old session completely
    await self.session_service.delete_session(...)
    
    # Create a completely new session with a new ID
    new_session = await self.session_service.create_session(
        app_name=self.app_name,
        user_id=self.user_id
    )
    
    # Create a new Runner instance for the new session
    new_runner = Runner(
        agent=root_agent,
        app_name=self.app_name,
        session_service=self.session_service
    )
    
    return new_runner, new_session.id
```

### 2. Updated `SlashCommandHandler.handle_clear` Method
- **File**: `cli/slash_commands.py`
- **Change**: Modified to return a dictionary containing the new runner and session information
- **Purpose**: Passes the new runner back to the chat loop

```python
async def handle_clear(self, session_id: Optional[str] = None):
    """Clear conversation history."""
    # ... confirmation logic ...
    
    if confirm:
        new_runner, new_session_id = await self.session_manager.clear_session(session_id)
        
        # Return the new runner and session ID
        return {"status": "SESSION_CLEARED", "runner": new_runner, "session_id": new_session_id}
```

### 3. Updated `SlashCommandHandler.handle_command` Method
- **File**: `cli/slash_commands.py`
- **Change**: Modified to handle and return the dictionary from `handle_clear`
- **Purpose**: Propagates the session clear information to the chat loop

### 4. Updated Chat Loop
- **File**: `cli/chat_loop.py`
- **Change**: Added logic to handle session clearing by updating the runner and session ID
- **Purpose**: Ensures the chat loop uses the new runner instance after clearing

```python
# Handle slash commands
result = await slash_handler.handle_command(user_input, session_id)
if result is None:  # Command was handled
    continue
elif isinstance(result, dict) and result.get("status") == "SESSION_CLEARED":
    # Session was cleared, update runner and session_id
    runner = result["runner"]
    session_id = result["session_id"]
    console.print(Panel(
        f"ðŸ”„ [green]Session cleared and refreshed![/green]",
        border_style="green",
        padding=(0, 1)
    ))
    continue
```

## Testing the Fix
After implementing these changes, the `/clear` command should:
1. Clear the conversation history in the database
2. Create a new `Runner` instance with no previous context
3. Update the chat loop to use the new runner
4. Ensure the agent has no memory of previous interactions

## Benefits
- **Complete Context Clear**: Both database and memory state are cleared
- **Proper Session Management**: New runner instance ensures clean state
- **User Experience**: Users can truly start fresh conversations
- **No Memory Leaks**: Old conversation context is properly disposed of

## Key Insight
The critical insight that made this fix work was understanding that the Google ADK stores conversation history as **events** in the session. Simply recreating a session with the same ID might not properly clear these events. By creating a completely new session with a new ID, we ensure that:

1. All previous conversation events are completely discarded
2. The new session starts with a clean event history
3. The agent has no access to previous conversation context

## Notes
- The session ID changes after clearing (to ensure complete state reset)
- The fix maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality
- All error handling and user confirmation flows remain unchanged
- Users see the new session ID to confirm the session was truly cleared
