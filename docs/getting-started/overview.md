# Overview

Welcome to **Murlix** – a revolutionary CLI chat interface that transforms how you interact with AI agents in the terminal. Built on Google's powerful Agent Development Kit (ADK), Murlix combines the efficiency of command-line tools with the elegance of modern user interfaces.

## What is Murlix?

Murlix is more than just another CLI tool. It's a comprehensive platform that brings beautiful, interactive AI conversations directly to your terminal, complete with:

- **Rich Visual Interface**: ASCII art, elegant formatting, and responsive design
- **Intelligent Session Management**: Persistent conversations that survive restarts
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy-to-customize agent configurations and commands
- **Modern UX**: Loading indicators, status panels, and intuitive interactions

## Core Philosophy

!!! quote "Design Principles"
    Murlix is built on the belief that command-line tools don't have to be ugly or difficult to use. We combine the power and flexibility of the terminal with modern design principles to create an experience that's both functional and delightful.

### Beautiful by Default

Every interaction in Murlix is designed to be visually appealing:

```bash
╭─ Murlix ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ Hello! I'm your AI assistant. I can help you with coding, writing,           │
│ problem-solving, and much more. What would you like to work on today?        │
╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

### Intelligent and Context-Aware

Murlix remembers your conversations and maintains context across sessions, making it feel like you're talking to a knowledgeable colleague rather than a stateless tool.
